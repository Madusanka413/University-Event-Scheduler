# Smart University Event Scheduler – Automated Conflict-Free Booking System

## Introduction
In our university, multiple student societies, unions, and committees organize events on designated days. However, manual scheduling often leads to conflicts, such as:

- **Double-booking of venues** – Two events scheduled at the same location and time.
- **Time slot clashes** – Overlapping events causing confusion among students.
- **Delays in event approvals** – Inefficient communication slowing down the approval process.

To solve these issues, we propose a **web-based event scheduler** that automates venue bookings, prevents conflicts, and streamlines event approvals.
